rye .needs { fyne }

; I was looking some into the error ... it looks to be caused by an infinite loop ... like calling a function that causes update in the update callback for example
; I minimized the code into this example ... if you check the checkbox it's already caused

do\in fyne {
	win: app
	|window "Rye Fyne Gallery"
	|resize size 500.0 500.0

	win
	|set-content v-box [
			check "Checkbox" closure { ok } { print "check" }
	]
	|show-and-run
}
