## Current status

Most widgets work. We just created a (CookBook with plenty of examples](https://ryelang.org/cookbook/rye-fyne/examples/). Next step will be to update this 
README and repository in general. To provide prebuild binaries, etc ... stay tuned.

## A Cookbook

I'm writing a Cookbook page full of simple GUI example. See them here:
https://ryelang.org/cookbook/rye-fyne/examples/

## What is Rye language

Rye is a high level, dynamic **programming language** based on ideas from **Rebol**, flavored by
Factor, Linux shells and Golang. It's still an experiment in language design, but it should slowly become more and
more useful in real world.

It features a Golang based interpreter and console and could also be seen as (modest) **Go's scripting companion** as
Go's libraries are quite easy to integrate, and Rye can be embedded into Go programs as a scripting or config language.

I believe that as language becomes higher level it starts touching the user interface boundary, besides being a language
we have great emphasis on **interactive use** (Rye shell) where we will explore that.
