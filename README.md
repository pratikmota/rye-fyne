## Current status

Most widgets work. We just created a (CookBook with plenty of examples](https://ryelang.org/cookbook/rye-fyne/examples/). Next step will be to update this 
README and repository in general. To provide prebuild binaries, etc ... stay tuned.

## A Cookbook

I'm writing a Cookbook page full of simple GUI example. See them here:
https://ryelang.org/cookbook/rye-fyne/examples/

## What is Rye language

Rye is a high level, dynamic **programming language** based on ideas from **Rebol**, flavored by
Factor, Linux shells and Golang. It's still an experiment in language design, but it should slowly become more and
more useful in real world.

It features a Golang based interpreter and console and could also be seen as (modest) **Go's scripting companion** as
Go's libraries are quite easy to integrate, and Rye can be embedded into Go programs as a scripting or config language.

I believe that as language becomes higher level it starts touching the user interface boundary, besides being a language
we have great emphasis on **interactive use** (Rye shell) where we will explore that.

**[Rye language repository](https://github.com/refaktor/rye)** | **[Rye website](https://ryelang.org/)** | **[Reddit group](https://reddit.com/r/ryelang/)**

### Why a separate repository

 * So Rye remains lighter on dependencies, easier to build, focused on backend and interactive shell
 * So that "frontend" related development is separated from language development
 * So that we test and improve on how users of Rye can externally extend it, add their own (private) bindings and write their own Go (private) builtin functions for hot-code optimization

#### Build and test

You need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed. Please follow Go's installation instructions for your opearating system. 

In **rye-fyne** directory run:

```
# build rye with fyne in bin/fyne/rye
./build

# Try the hello example
bin/rye examples/fyne/button.rye

# Try the feedback example
bin/rye examples/fyne/feedback.rye

# Try the Live GUI demo
bin/rye examples/fyne/live.rye
```

#### Example

![Fyne Feedback example](https://ryelang.org/rye-fyne-2.png)

```
rye .needs { fyne }

do\in fyne {

	cont: container 'vbox vals {
		label "Send us feedback:"
		multiline-entry :ent
		button "Send" { ent .get-text |printv "Sending: {}" }
	}
	
	app .new-window "Feedback"
	|set-content cont
	|show-and-run
}
```
